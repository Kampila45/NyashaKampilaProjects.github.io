									<h2><a href="https://github.com/Kampila45/Personal-Projects/blob/main/Impact%20of%20FDI%20on%20Exchange%20rates.wf1">Zambian FDI Dynamics: Currency, Growth, and Inflation Impact<br />
							        </a></h2>
									<p>This project involved cleaning secondary data obtained from sources such as the Bank of Zambia (BoZ) and the World Bank using Excel. The refined dataset was then analyzed in E-Views to explore the relationship between currency volatility and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Zambia. Additionally, other variables like inflation rate (measured by GDP deflator) and economic growth (indicated by GDP per capita) were examined to understand their connections with FDI. The findings of the study indicated that currency volatility had a weak negative impact on FDI. In contrast, economic growth demonstrated a significant positive effect on FDI, highlighting its substantial influence. Moreover, the analysis revealed a negative relationship between inflation and FDI, suggesting that higher inflation rates were associated with a decrease in foreign direct investment. In summary, this research contributes valuable insights into FDI dynamics in Zambia. It emphasizes the limited impact of currency volatility, the considerable positive influence of economic growth, and the detrimental effect of inflation on foreign direct investment in the country.</p>

							<p>This project utilized R programming language to analyze a dataset sourced from Kaggle, aiming to understand the factors affecting health insurance charges. The dataset included variables like age, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, sex, and region. Initial exploratory data analysis involved calculating correlations and creating boxplots to visualize the distribution of charges across categories such as smoking status, sex, and region. Subsequently, a linear regression model was constructed to predict insurance charges based on these variables. The model highlighted that age, BMI, smoking habits, and the number of children significantly influence insurance charges. With an adjusted R-squared value of 0.7494, the model indicates that approximately 75% of the variability in insurance charges can be explained by the selected predictors. This project underscores the significance of lifestyle choices and demographic factors in shaping health insurance costs, providing valuable insights for both insurers and policyholders.</p>
